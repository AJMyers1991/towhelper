# towhelper
A simple small script to help with some towing funcitonality in fivem.


This resource will disable the control inputs for the bed slide function on rollback tow trucks when the vehicle is in motion.  It will also bypass
the inability to use the rotator boom on FoxTrotDelta's heavy wrecker if you are using a framework or inventory system that disables the weapon-wheel.

It contains a configuration file if you need to change anything for your server or application.

This was created for my own server so feel free to customize to suit your needs!
